I’m a data scientist, recovering academic, and social entrepreneur with a passion for inspiring change with data storytelling.

### More Information

I’ve worked at the intersection of science, policy, and education for more than 10 years. The only thing I love more than data is **_telling stories_** with data, and using data storytelling as a vehicle for positive change. Translating science into impact has been the constant throughout my career. I’ve done it in academia, at nonprofits, and currently through my consulting company, [Science By Design](https://www.science-by-design.com/).
